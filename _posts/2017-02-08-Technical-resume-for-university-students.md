Using gaudy fonts, confusing layouts, tiny font sizes, or aggressive color schemes distracts the reader from easily consuming the information. A good rule thumb that I like to adhere to is this, unless you're applying for a designer position of some sort just stick to black and white. **Two**, a good resume is able to convey your knowledge
