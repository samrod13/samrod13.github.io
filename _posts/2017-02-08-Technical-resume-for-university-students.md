## Do I really need a resume?

Yes, you do. As more and more cs majors enter the job market each year, your resume is your ticket to distinguishing yourself amidst a sea of candidates. Some companies tend to post problems on platforms like Hackerrank and candidates who are able to solve those challenges get invited to interview with the company. Typically these problems are quite difficult and are not for the faint of heart. Unless you are extremely comfortable with solving complex coding challenges, your best bet for getting an interview is a stellar resume.

## Structure to success

The entire recruiting process starts with a recruiter reading your resume. They usually take about a minute, maybe two, on each resume and decide whether that candidate would be worth investing more time into. This is where the majority of resumes fail, typically around 50% or more. But why?

A good resume is able to do three things effectively. **One**, it presents information in a manner that is easy for the recruiter to digest. Using gaudy fonts, confusing layouts, tiny font sizes, or aggressive color schemes distracts the reader from easily consuming the information. A good rule thumb that I like to adhere to is this, unless you're applying for a designer position of some sort just stick to black and white. **Two**, a good resume is able to convey your knowledge as it applies to the position. If you're applying for a purely front end position, filling half your resume with projects from your OS class isn't smart. A recruiter's job is find candidates that have the best skillset to succeed at the job, and your job is to make the best case for that. Not everything has to be related to the position, but make sure at least 70% of your resume is relevant to the position. **Three**, a good a resume is able to convey your enthusiasm for the position. This one is trickier but, in general, having projects that show your awareness of the specific field or previous work experience is a good bet.  

With lots of misinformation going around and a general lack of interest in crafting a good resume, its no wonder why so many candidates never hear back from recruiters. Simply structuring your resume correctly is the easiest thing that you can do to ensure that you have the best chance of getting a response. 

## Breaking it down

I will break down the essential parts of the resume and discuss my tips for each section.

### Education

In general, you should include your school, major(s), concentration, expected graduation date, and your gpa. If your gpa is less than stellar, simply omit it altogether. If you're a freshman or a sophomore, you can also include your high school information though keep the included information basic. Recruiters don't care you were 3-time President of the Debate Club or 2nd chair violin.

### Objective

I'm personally against this unless you're a Ph.D. student, Master's student, or you are applying for a purely research position for company. It wastes valuable space and doesn't really add anything meaninful to your application. Avoid it altogether and focus on improving other parts of your resume.

### Work experience

This is probably one of the top two ways that recruiters will sort your resume by, make it count. You should be clear as to what you actually did in that position and what your main responsibilities were. Use strong verbs, adjectives and avoid using filler words. List important frameworks and software services that you used. Quantify your efforts when possible. Keep the entire description for each position to about 50-60 words, give or take.

"What if I have never worked at a software company?" Don't fret about it because you can still put what ever experience you have in here. If you've worked multiple jobs that aren't software related, try to include only one with about a sentence description to convey what you did in that position. If you find that this section is lacking for you then focus on making your projects section the bulk of your resume. It's not the end of the world, and people still get callbacks for having less than stellar work experience with strong personal projects.

### Personal projects

Admittedly this is the other section that will heavily influce the recruiter. Quality over quantity here. A recruiter, or an engineer for that matter, is not looking for a myriad of small, rather lackluster projects. Instead, focus on having two to three really strong, well documented, well written, and thoughtful projects. Simply having a bunch of hello world projects just so that you can pad your resume with all of these technologies/languages won't get you anwywhere. Include your github/bitbucket link at the top of your resume so that people can see your code.

"What constitutes a 'good' project and how can I find good ideas for a project?" This is hard to answer because its all dependent on your relative knowledge and how much you are able/willing to apply yourself. I understand that not everyone has 24/7 internet access or the time to spend 3 hours a day coding a project. Different responsibilities eat up our time, but try to put in as much time as you can. If you already know a specific language/framework pretty well, you should try to really push your limits. Simply building a Django web app that displays a clock, serves static text, or something that requires user input via the command line a la AP CS isn't exactly stellar. It's great when you're a freshman but nowadays you have to push the limits. Learn to scrape websites for data, then parse that data and present it with a nice visual using d3.js. Make your web app interact with another API to fetch data, store it on a backend, and do some neat calculations. These are just some examples of things that you can do to spice up you simple Django web app. Taking your personal projects to the next level will require you to do some research on your end to learn more about the language/framework. 

I read somewhere where a person was suggesting about simply copying dev tutorials verbatim and slapping them on your resume just as is. I generally advocate against this for several reasons. One, you didn't learn anything and youre simply copying what someone else did. It won't help you in the long run. Two, you're setting yourself up for failure when your interviewer starts poking at the project and you can't answer simple questions. What I do advocate is using dev tutorials, learning from them, taking them as a shell and building more features on top of what they have already showed you. Maybe the the tutorial is on classifying  handwritten digits using tensorflow and you take that and adapt it to also work with the entire alphabet. That's worth doing. Focus on making it your own and your projects will stand out.

### Volunteer work, et cetera...

In general, unless it's somehow related to CS or the job just leave it out. It's great that you helped have helped out your local humane society or you volunteered to raise awareness for a cause, but it won't help the recruiter build a case as to why he/she should call you back. Save those extra hobbies of yours for the phone interview.

### Programming languages

This is probably the second most important section in your resume after experience and personal projects so don't blow it off. **One**, don't list that you know macOS and windows and some distribution of linux. As a CS major, it's expected that you can pick up this kind of stuff relatively easy. If anything, just put unix and call it a day. Also please don't confuse knowing unix with bash scripting, I made that mistake early on and it cost me. **Two**, don't start listing every IDE that you know. Unless you're working for a company that uses specialized tools that integrate well with their workflow (think Autodesk using Visual Studio for C++ development for example), companies don't really care what you use to code in. Whether it's vim or atom or eclipse, just leave it out. **Three**, do not **list every programming language that you've ever heard of**. It's like tying a noose around your neck and handing the end to the interviewer. Only list languages that you're proficient or you feel like could easily learn more about. For most undergraduates this will typically be 3-4 languages, not including HTML/CSS. As far as framworks go, let your projects show which ones you've worked with. It makes it more easier for the recruiter to see the languages that you know right away.

"But isn't it better when I can show that I 'know' all 8 of these programming languages?" Well, no. Unless you feel comfortable going into a conversation with an engineer about language internals/specifics, don't include it. Interviewers are really good at spotting that out and it doesn't bode well for you when they do.  Let your knowledge be T-shaped, know that other options exist and some superficial things about those but be able to go deep on a couple of those. It shows that you have awareness and that you can dive deep when you learn the material. No one wants a developer who has superficial knowledge about anything and can't dive deep on anything.

This would also be the section where you would include any other languages that you know like Spanish or French. Avoid listing languages that you wouldn't feel comfortable having an easy conversation in. 

## Closing thoughts

Your resume is really a carefully shaped mirror that perfectly reflects what you know. It's not a mystery and it's not impossible to craft a good resume. I'm not guaranteeing that following these guidelines will land you an internship or full time position. This is based on my personal experience and what has worked for me. Take what you want, leave what you don't.
