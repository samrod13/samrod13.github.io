## Do I really need a resume?

Yes, you do. As more and more cs majors enter the job market each year, your resume is your ticket to distinguishing yourself amidst a sea of candidates. Some companies tend to post problems on platforms like Hackerrank and candidates who are able to solve those challenges get invited to interview with the company. Typically these problems are quite difficult and are not for the faint of heart. Unless you are extremely comfortable with solving complex coding challenges, your best bet for getting an interview is a stellar resume.

## Structure to Success

The entire recruiting process starts with a recruiter reading your resume. They usually take about a minute, maybe two, on each resume and decide whether that candidate would be worth investing more time into. This is where the majority of resumes fail, typically around 50% or more. But why?

A good resume is able to do three things effectively. **One**, it presents information in a manner that is easy for the recruiter to digest. Using gaudy fonts, confusing layouts, tiny font sizes, or aggressive color schemes distracts the reader from easily consuming the information. A good rule thumb that I like to adhere to is this, unless you're applying for a designer position of some sort just stick to black and white. **Two**, a good resume is able to convey your knowledge as it applies to the position. If you're applying for a purely front end position, filling half your resume with projects from your OS class isn't smart. A recruiter's job is find candidates that have the best skillset to succeed at the job, and your job is to make the best case for that. Not everything has to be related to the position, but make sure at least 70% of your resume is relevant to the position. **Three**, a good a resume is able to convey your enthusiasm for the position. This one is trickier but, in general, having projects that show your awareness of the specific field or previous work experience is a good bet. 

Simply structuring your resume correctly is the easiest thing that you can do to ensure that you have the best chance of getting a response. 

## Breaking it down

I will break down the essential parts of the resume and discuss my tips for each section.

### Education

In general, you should include your school, major(s), concentration, expected graduation date, and your gpa. If your gpa is less than stellar, simply omit it altogether. If you're a freshman or a sophomore, you can also include your high school information though keep the included information basic. Recruiters don't care you were 3-time President of the Debate Club or 2nd chair violin.

### Objective

I'm personally against this unless you're a Ph.D. student, Master's student, or you are applying for a purely research position for company. It wastes valuable space and doesn't really add anything meaninful to your application. Avoid it altogether and focus on improving other parts of your resume.

### Work Experience

This is probably one of the top two ways that recruiters will sort your resume by, make it count. You should be clear as to what you actually did in that position and what your main responsibilities were. Use strong verbs, adjectives and avoid using
